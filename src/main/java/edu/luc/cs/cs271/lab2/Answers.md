## What is the complexity of each of the four search methods in terms of array or list size n?

The search methods used were array and list for "findTeamPosition". 
For "findTeamPositionMinFunding we ued a linear search which means it starts the search at the begining value and checks 1 by 1,
but for "findTeamMinFundingFast we used a binary search which means it starts the search at the middle value of the array if the middle value is not a match it will determine which side (if any) the correct value is at and eliminated the search on the other half.


# What happens in the case of binary search if the array is not sorted?

The binary search is inefficient. It is used for sorted list. 

# What is the purpose of constructor argument validity checking?

The purpose is to check the parameters early on so that no errors appear. 


# What is the purpose of using the keyword `final` with variables and arguments?

The purpose of "final" is to declare the value of constant and could not be altered. 
You are not allowed to change that reference and compiler will verify this and raise a compilation error if you try to re-initialized final variables.


# What are alternatives to using `Optional` and how do they compare?
